# 📊 **Term Deposit Prediction Model**

Welcome to the **Term Deposit Prediction** project! 🚀 

In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features. This helps optimize the **telephonic marketing efforts** by identifying the best targets.

---

## 💡 **Project Overview**
The dataset used in this project represents a **direct marketing campaign** by a Portuguese bank. The task is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on personal and campaign-related features.

---

## 📊 **Data Features**
- **Demographic information**: Age, job, marital status, education, balance, loan types, etc.
- **Campaign Features**: Last contact duration, communication type, number of contacts, and outcome from previous campaigns.
- **Target**: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`).

---

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Power BI** / **Excel**: Visualizing key metrics and insights.

## 📌 **Getting Started**
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building the machine learning model, EDA was performed to better understand the data.

Example Visualizations:
Target Variable Distribution: Analyzing how many clients subscribed vs did not subscribe to a term deposit.
Correlation Heatmap: To identify relationships between numerical features.
